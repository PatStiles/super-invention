# X-Team 18 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We'll assign tasks after discussing them in our group chat.


## How will we track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Check whether the last person completed his task before everyone starts his task. 


## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Discussing it in our group chat.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Discussing our progress in our group chat.
